# Spark submit

The Spark submit image serves as a base image to submit your application on a Spark cluster. This may be either a Java or Scala application. Python support will be added in the near future. See [big-data-europe/docker-spark README](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-spark) for a description how to submit your own application to a Spark cluster.
